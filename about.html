        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Peterson's Algorithm is a classical solution to the <strong>critical section problem</strong> in concurrent programming, providing a mechanism for ensuring mutual exclusion between two processes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The algorithm uses two variables, <code>flag[0], flag[1]</code>, to represent the intent of each process, and a shared <code>turn</code> variable to ensure that the processes take turns accessing the critical section. The logic works as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>flag[0], flag[1]</code>: Represents whether the process wants to enter the critical section.</li>
          <li><code>turn</code>: Ensures that the other process gets a chance to enter the critical section if both processes desire it at the same time.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="concepts">
        <h2>Important Concepts</h2>
        <p>Peterson's Algorithm ensures the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mutual Exclusion:</strong> No two processes can be in the critical section simultaneously.</li>
          <li><strong>Progress:</strong> If no process is in the critical section, one will eventually enter.</li>
          <li><strong>Bounded Waiting:</strong> Each process gets a fair opportunity to enter the critical section after a bounded amount of time.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="limitations">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>While Peterson's Algorithm is a brilliant solution for two processes, it does not extend to systems with more than two processes. This limitation makes it more suitable as a teaching tool than a production-level solution in modern computing systems.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="real-world">
        <h2>Usage in Real-World Systems</h2>
        <p>Primarily used for educational purposes, Peterson's Algorithm provides a foundational understanding of synchronization concepts. However, more scalable and efficient algorithms like <strong>Lamport's Bakery Algorithm</strong> or <strong>Mutex</strong> are used in real-world systems.</p>
